Our members and guests come together to make our meetings fun, welcoming and memorable for all, as we share stories of the Earth, its people and our human experiences.\n\nNever heard of Toastmasters? It's a global organization of clubs dedicated to improving our public speaking skills for all levels in a safe, welcoming environment.\n\nToastmasters helps us clearly communicate our thoughts and build confidence in endless areas:\n\n‚úî Work presentations\n\n‚úî Wedding speeches\n\n‚úî Job interviews\n\n‚úî First dates\n\n‚úî School project presentations\n\n‚úî Making new friends\n\n‚úî Any and every other situation where you need to talk to people!\n\nWe acknowledge you for reading this far which means you're probably at least somewhat interested!\n\nWe LOVE having guests at our club.

And for most of us, that was 'terrified'.\n\nYou took the leap and showed up, and the first step is always the hardest. The rest?

      "Be our guest! Experience a Toastmasters meeting with the North Delta Power Talkers. You can simply come and observe, or you can participate. There's no fee to be a guest.\n\nThe meeting begins at 6:45 and ends by 8:30, with a 5 to 10-minute break.\n\nWe are running our meetings as a hybrid format, below is the link to the zoom meeting.\n\nhttps://zoom.us/j/778578001?pwd=NU1hYzNNenZuTk5JL1NzakYydUFHQT09\n\nOr launch Zoom and enter the following coordinates:\n\nMeeting ID: 778 578 001\n\nPasscode: 858973\n\nIf you would like to join us in person, we are meeting at Sunstone Village - The Residences in the amenities room. There will be a signboard outside to help you find us, with plenty of visitor parking as well.\n\n**What to Expect**\n\nThe goal of every meeting is to give everyone a chance to speak and to develop their leadership skills. Members take on various roles to ensure we have an entertaining and smoothly-run meeting.\n\nHere is what happens at a typical meeting:\n\nOne member will act as Chairperson. This person manages the meeting and keeps everything on track and on time.\n\nOther members will perform various roles; Timer, Jokemaster, Grammarian (introduce a word and encourage its spontaneous use in speeches, and watch for \"filler\" words).\n\nTable Topics - 20 minutes - This is a time when members practice spontaneous public speaking. A member chairs this portion, asks questions relating to the night's theme, and 4-6 members are invited to stand up and give a 1-2 minute speech in response. It is voluntary (for guests), a terrific learning tool, and popular among the members.\n\nWe have a 5-10 minute break halfway through for some snacks. If you join us in person, we often have some wine to share!\n\nThe second half of the meeting begins with a toast, delivered by the night's Toastmaster who then conducts the prepared speeches portion of the night.\n\nTwo or three prepared speeches are delivered by members. Each speech is approximately 5-10 minutes in length.\n\nDesignated members will deliver speech evaluations consisting of positive and constructive feedback that helps each speaker improve their speaking skills. This is another excellent learning tool delivered in a positive, helpful way.\n\nThe Summary reports for each of the roles mentioned earlier in the meeting (Grammarian and Timer) are delivered.\n\nA General Evaluation on how the meeting was conducted is presented.\n\nThe Chairperson wraps up the meeting.\n\nMembers are encouraged to choose speech topics with broad appeal, and they do. We hear remarkable stories about the experiences of our members, from growing up in Nepal to entertaining as a magician on a casino ship on the Yangtze River to the joy of mentoring students towards rewarding careers.\n\nCome visit. Take on a new challenge and support others doing the same.\n\nDoors open at 6:30, meeting starts at 6:45, wraps at 8:30.",
